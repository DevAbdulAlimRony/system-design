System Design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements.
1. What: It defines the structural "skeleton." This involves choosing the right components—such as web servers, API gateways, databases, and caches—and deciding how they will be organized.
2. How: ystem design dictates how data flows from point A to point B, whether that’s through synchronous REST calls or asynchronous message queues like Kafka.
3. The constraints: Scalability(Can it handle more load?), Availability(Is it always online?), Reliability(Does it work correctly under pressure?), Maintainability(Can other engineers fix it later?).

System design focuses on the internal structure and behavior of the system, considering factors such as performance, scalability, reliability, maintainability, and security. It involves making decisions about the system’s components, their interactions, and their relationships to external systems or modules.

Building Blocks:
1. Database: Relational (SQL) vs Non-Relationsal (No SQL)
2. Caching
3. Database Sharding: Splitting a giant database into smaller, faster chunks.
4. Replication: Copying data across servers so it's never lost.
5. Proxies: Forward vs. Reverse proxies (like Nginx).
6. APIs: REST, GraphQL, and gRPC.
7. Message Queues: Asynchronous communication (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) so services can talk without waiting for each other.
8. Microservices vs. Monolith: One giant app vs. many small, specialized services.
9. Content Delivery Networks (CDN): Storing static files (images/video) physically closer to the user.
10. CAP Theorem: The trade-off between Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.

Flow:
Client-> DNS -> CDN -> Load Balancer -> Web Server -> Worker Service, Queue -> Write/Read API -> Memory Cache -> SQL NoSQL.

Outline Use Cases, Constraints and assumptions:

    Who is going to use it?
    How are they going to use it?
    How many users are there?
    What does the system do?
    What are the inputs and outputs of the system?
    How much data do we expect to handle?
    How many requests per second do we expect?
    What is the expected read to write ratio?
