* Load Balancer: Deliver boy or customer will take order from shop a or b.
They will decide which shop can deliver in the lowest time, and order from that shop. 
Thats the load balancer. Load Balancer acts as a "traffic cop" sitting in front of your servers. Its job is to route incoming client requests across all servers capable of fulfilling those requests in a way that maximizes speed and capacity utilization.
Take the requests from server and evenly balance the load on our servers.
The concept of consistent hashing will help us to do that.
